# DevOps Pipeline Implementation - Technical Writeup

## Overview

Built a complete CI/CD pipeline for a simple Node.js logo server. The goal was to demonstrate modern DevOps practices with automation from code to production.

## Tools I Used

**Jenkins**: Chose this for CI/CD because it's widely used in enterprise environments. Set up with shared libraries to avoid repeating pipeline code.

**Docker + AWS ECR**: Containerized the app for consistency across environments. ECR integrates well with other AWS services.

**Kubernetes + Helm**: K8s for orchestration, Helm for package management. Makes deployments repeatable and easy to rollback.

**ArgoCD**: Implements GitOps - the cluster pulls changes rather than Jenkins pushing. More secure and gives better visibility.

**Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for the AWS setup. Makes it easy to recreate environments.

## Architecture Flow

```
Developer pushes code → Jenkins builds & tests → Docker image to ECR → 
Helm chart updated → ArgoCD syncs → App deployed to K8s
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Jenkins Shared Library Setup
**Problem**: Pipeline was getting complex with repeated code blocks
**Solution**: Created a separate repo with reusable Groovy functions. Now the Jenkinsfile is clean and other projects can use the same functions.

### Challenge 2: ECR Authentication in Jenkins
**Problem**: Jenkins couldn't push to ECR - authentication kept failing
**Solution**: Used IAM roles instead of hardcoded credentials. Created a shared library function that handles the ECR login automatically.

### Challenge 3: ArgoCD + Helm Integration  
**Problem**: ArgoCD wasn't detecting changes in the Helm chart repo
**Solution**: Configured ArgoCD to watch the Helm repo directly. Now when Jenkins updates the image tag, ArgoCD picks it up within minutes.

### Challenge 4: Kubernetes Networking
**Problem**: App wasn't accessible from outside the cluster
**Solution**: Used proper Service and Ingress configuration in the Helm chart. For AWS, LoadBalancer type works best.

## What Worked Well

- **Separation of Concerns**: App code, pipeline code, infrastructure code, and deployment configs are all in separate repos
- **GitOps Approach**: Having ArgoCD pull changes is much cleaner than Jenkins pushing
- **Shared Libraries**: Makes pipeline code reusable across projects
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Can spin up the entire environment with one Terraform command

## What I'd Improve

**Security**: Add vulnerability scanning with tools like Trivy or Snyk in the pipeline

**Testing**: Currently no automated tests. Would add unit tests, integration tests, and maybe some smoke tests post-deployment

**Monitoring**: Basic logging is there, but would add Prometheus + Grafana for proper metrics and alerting

**Multi-Environment**: Right now everything goes to one cluster. Would set up dev/staging/prod environments with different configurations

**Secrets Management**: Using Kubernetes secrets, but AWS Secrets Manager or Vault would be better for production

**Backup Strategy**: Need automated backups for the application data and cluster state

## Cost Considerations

The Terraform setup creates a full production environment but costs around $200-250/month. For development:
- Could use smaller instance types
- Single-node EKS cluster
- Spot instances for worker nodes
- This would bring cost down to ~$100/month

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Began with a basic pipeline and added complexity gradually
2. **Documentation Matters**: Good README and architecture diagrams save time later
3. **Automation is Key**: Manual steps always get forgotten or done inconsistently
4. **Security First**: Set up IAM roles properly from the beginning
5. **Monitor Everything**: Logs and metrics are crucial for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

- **Blue/Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with traffic switching
- **Auto-scaling**: HPA for the application, cluster autoscaler for nodes
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region setup with automated failover
- **Policy as Code**: Use Open Policy Agent for security and compliance policies

This project gave me hands-on experience with the entire DevOps toolchain. The most valuable learning was understanding how all these tools work together to create a reliable, automated deployment pipeline.
